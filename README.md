Let's make a simple game!
For start download  and include script from the GitHub...
```html
<body>
  <script src = "path/to/the/game.js"></script>
  <canvas id = "canvas" width = "500" height = "500"></canvas>
</body>
```

```javascript
var zombie = new Image();
zombie.src = path/to/image/zombie.png;
```
...And draw some objectives...
```javascript
//Make it in draw() function!!!
zombie.x = 0; //x

```
